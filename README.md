## Database Design and Implementation

# Scenario

In this scenario, you have recently been hired as a Data Engineer by a New York based coffee shop chain that is looking to expand
nationally by opening a number of franchise locations. As part of their expansion process, they want to streamline operations and
revamp their data infrastructure.
Your job is to design their relational database systems for improved operational efficiencies and to make it easier for their executives to
make data driven decisions.
Currently their data resides in several different systems: accounting software, suppliersâ€™ databases, point of sales (POS) systems, and even
spreadsheets. You will review the data in all of these systems and design a central database to house all of the data. you will then create
the database objects and load them with source data. Finally, you will create subsets of data that your business partners require, export
them, and then load them into staging databases that use different RDBMS.
